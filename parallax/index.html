          <h1>SPRING</h1><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="des">
        <p>Spring, in climatology, season of the year between winter and summer during 
            which temperatures gradually rise. It is generally defined in the Northern Hemisphere as 
            extending from the vernal equinox (day and night equal in length), March 20 or 21, to the 
            summer solstice (year’s longest day), June 21 or 22, and in the Southern Hemisphere from 
            September 22 or 23 to December 22 or 23. The spring temperature transition from winter cold 
            to summer heat 
            occurs only in middle and high latitudes; near the Equator, temperatures vary little during 
            the year. Spring is very short in the polar regions. For physical causes of the seasons, see season.

            <p>In many cultures spring has been celebrated with rites and festivals 
            revolving around its importance in food production. In European languages, the concept
             of spring is associated with the sowing of crops. During this time of the year all plants, 
             including cultivated ones, begin growth anew after the dormancy of winter. Animals are greatly
              affected, too: they come out of their winter dormancy or hibernation and begin their nesting 
              and reproducing activities, and birds migrate poleward in response to the warmer temperatures.</p>

          <h1>SUMMER</h1><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="des"><p>Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn. 
        Temperatures over the period differ based upon the location on the Earth; regions near the 
        equator are typically warmer than those lying near the poles. This is because, due to the curve 
        of the Earth, these places receive the most sunlight, according to Pedagogy in Action. 
        The areas around the Earth's poles also have ice, which reflect a lot of the sun's rays.  </p>

       <p> The summer equinox occurs when the sun passes directly above the equator because of the 
        tilt of the Earth. When the seasons are based on the Earth's position in relation to the sun, 
        it is called astronomical summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, astronomical summer happens on 
        or around June 21. The North Pole is tilted at the greatest angle toward the sun at this time. 
        In the Southern Hemisphere, summer occurs on or around Dec. 22, according to the National Oceanic and 
        Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),(opens in new tab) when the South Pole is tilted toward the sun. </p>

          <h1>AUTUMN</h1><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="des">
        <p>Autumn, season of the year between summer and winter during which temperatures gradually decrease. 
            It is often called fall in the United States because leaves fall from the trees at that time. Autumn 
            is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as the period between the autumnal equinox (day and night 
            equal in length), September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year’s shortest day), December 21 or 22; 
            and in the Southern Hemisphere as the period between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22. The autumn 
            temperature transition between summer heat and winter cold occurs only in middle and high latitudes; 
            in equatorial regions, temperatures 
            generally vary little during the year. In the polar regions autumn is very short. </p>
            <p>
                The concept of autumn in European languages is connected with the harvesting of crops; 
                in many cultures autumn, like the other seasons, has been marked by rites and festivals 
                revolving around the season’s importance in food production. Animals gather food in autumn 
                in preparation for the coming winter, and those with fur often grow thicker coats. Many birds 
                migrate toward the Equator to escape the falling temperatures. A common autumn phenomenon in the 
                central and eastern United States and in Europe is Indian summer, 
                a period of unseasonably warm weather that sometimes occurs in late October or November.

          <h1>WINTER</h1>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="des">
        <p>Winter, coldest season of the year, between autumn and spring; the name comes 
            from an old Germanic word that means “time of water” and refers to the rain and 
            snow of winter in middle and high latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere it is 
            commonly regarded as extending from the winter solstice (year’s shortest day), 
            December 21 or 22, to the vernal equinox (day and night equal in length), March 20 or 21, 
            and in the Southern Hemisphere from June 21 or 22 to September 22 or 23. The low 
            temperatures associated with winter occur only in middle and high latitudes; 
            in equatorial regions, temperatures 
            are almost uniformly high throughout the year.</p>
            <p>The concept of winter in European languages is associated with the 
                season of dormancy, particularly in relation to crops; some plants 
                die, leaving their seeds, and others merely cease growth until spring. 
                Many animals also become dormant, especially those that hibernate; numerous insects die.</p>
